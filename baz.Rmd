This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This example also shows how you can get data files from Synapse, and then **Knit** this file to a Synapse Wiki. You will need to install the [knit2synapse](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/knit2synapse) package to do this:

```
devtools:install_github("Sage-Bionetworks/knit2synapse")
```

Then, either upload this `Rmd` file to Synapse, or a link to a Github checkin. I'm doing the latter here, using `rGithubClient`.

Then, outside of this file, you'll run the following:

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(rGithubClient)
library(knit2synapse)

thisRepo <- getRepo("kdaily/myu4cproj")
thisScript <- getPermlink(thisRepo, "baz.Rmd")

thisFile <- File(, )

knitfile2synapse(file = "./baz.Rmd", 
                 owner = 'syn3642859', 
                 wikiName = "Merge foo and bar.",overwrite=F)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
